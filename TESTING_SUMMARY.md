## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues (Require Production Setup)

### 1. **Authentication System**
**Issue**: No users can sign in (auth routes don't exist)
- Auth errors in console (expected - no database connection)
- `/auth/signin` returns 404
- Booking requires authentication

**Fix Needed**:
- Set up actual database connection (Supabase credentials)
- Create sign-in page
- Configure OAuth providers (Google already configured in .env)

### 2. **Database Connection**
**Issue**: Can't reach Supabase database
```
Can't reach database server at `db.vnealghwegadhvkaehsp.supabase.co:5432`
```

**Impact**:
- Auth sessions fail
- Bookings fail with 500 error
- Category filtering may not work properly

**Fix Needed**:
- Verify Supabase database is running
- Check DATABASE_URL in .env
- May need to unpause Supabase project

### 3. **Payment Integration**
**Issue**: Payment intent creation fails (500 error)
```
POST /api/create-payment-intent 500 in 2394ms
```

**Root Cause**: No authenticated user + missing Stripe test credentials

**Fix Needed**:
- Add actual Stripe test keys to .env
- Authenticate as a user
- Test full payment flow

### 4. **Email Notifications**
**Status**: Not tested (requires actual booking to complete)

**Fix Needed**:
- Add RESEND_API_KEY to .env
- Configure RESEND_FROM_EMAIL
- Complete a test booking to trigger email

### 5. **Image Upload**
**Status**: Not tested (requires authentication)

**Fix Needed**:
- Add UPLOADTHING_SECRET and UPLOADTHING_APP_ID to .env
- Sign in as host
- Test creating activity with image uploads
